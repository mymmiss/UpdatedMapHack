This is a completly revamped version of MapHack to be used with kolbot.

## Features

## How to use
It should be simple enough. Download the contents of this repo. Copy and paste them into your kolbot download.
Make sure you have this version of kolbot https://github.com/blizzhackers/kolbot if you don't then this won't work simple as that.

## Collaborting
