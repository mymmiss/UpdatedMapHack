# UpdatedMapHack
An updated version of maphack

## How to use
It should be simple enough. Download the contents of this repo. Copy and paste them into your kolbot download.
Make sure you have this version of kolbot https://github.com/blizzhackers/kolbot if you don't then this won't work simple as that.
Past that this is a work in progress but I have added some new features such as shrine names, color coding, uber portals, and working on item markers (kind of like a loot filter)

## Enjoy
